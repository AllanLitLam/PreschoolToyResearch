# Preschool Toy Research (Qualitative UX Case Study)

## üìò Overview

This project presents a sample of qualitative UX research conducted during my internship at a toy manufacturing company. The goal was to help the product design team evaluate several best-selling preschool toys and identify opportunities for new products that better support imaginative play, pretend play, and preschool-friendly design.

Due to NDA restrictions, the product name, visual assets, and internal strategy outcomes cannot be shared. However, this repository includes a sample of the review coding structure and thematic analysis I conducted to support early-stage product exploration.

## üéØ Project Objective

- Evaluate the pros and cons of top-selling toys based on customer reviews online.
- Identify features that promote or hinder imaginative and pretend play.
- Highlight preschool-age design considerations such as safety and usability.
- Use insights to inform product design discussions and prototyping direction.

---

## üß† Research Questions

- What do customers consistently appreciate or criticize about a product?
- Which features support open-ended, creative play for preschool-aged children?
- What improvements would make the product safer, more usable, or more engaging?

---

## üîç Methods

### Review Selection
- Analyzed over 100 verified customer reviews from major retail sites.
- Reviews focused on top-selling items that the client requested for new designs.

### Thematic Coding
- Applied open coding to tag reviews by sentiment and theme.
- Key themes included:
  - Imaginative Play
  - Play Value
  - Piece Count
  - Realistic
  - Parent Satisfaction
  - Observation Insight
