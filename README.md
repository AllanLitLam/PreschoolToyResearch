# UX Research - Preschool line (Qualitative Case Study)

## Overview

This repository presents a sample Scope of Work (SOW) document from a qualitative UX research project conducted during my internship at a toy manufacturer. The goal of this research was to support early product development by analyzing customer feedback on high-performing preschool toys from competing brands.

Due to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), specific products, visual assets, and internal outcomes are not shared. However, this sample showcases the structure, research focus, and methods I used to guide product strategy in collaboration with the design team.

## Business Problem and Research Question

The core business problem is to increase sales by incorporating trending toy features into our new product designs. My analysis aims to answer: 

- What features are consistently praised in verified customer reviews?
- What complaints are consistently raised across products?
- What toy features are frequently commented on with imaginative or pretend play?
- What shared characteristics appear across past best-selling items?
